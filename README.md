# Compose Animation 
This repository covers various animations using Jetpack Compose, making animations smooth and easy to build. Explore practical examples for an engaging learning experience.

### 1. Items Placement 
We can easly animate the offset of the items of LazyRow/Column or Grid by just adding the `animateItemPlacement` to modifier of the Item. 
#### Steps 
1. Add the key attribute to the `items` in LazyRow/Column or Grid. <br>
   `items(items = list.value, key = { it.id })`
2. Create Animation <br>
   `val itemPlacementAnim: FiniteAnimationSpec<IntOffset> = tween(700, easing = LinearOutSlowInEasing)`
3. Add the `animateItemPlacement` to Item Modifier <br>
`PlayerItem(player = it, modifier = Modifier.animateItemPlacement(itemPlacementAnim))`
4. Thats it now the whenever the Items placement will be changed then Animation will make the magic ðŸª„ <br>
